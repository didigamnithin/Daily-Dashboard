# ✅ Daily Dashboard - Final Status

## 🎉 Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Slack Configuration Fixed
- **Problem**: `slack_token: False` was showing even though webhook was configured
- **Solution**: Updated validation to check for both `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
- **Status**: ✅ **Slack is now properly configured** (`slack_configured: True`)

### 2. ✅ Data Fetching Fixed
- **Problem**: No data was being returned from BigQuery queries
- **Root Cause**: Data is 4 days behind (latest data is from 2025-09-10, not 2025-09-12)
- **Solution**: Updated all date calculations to use `today-4` instead of `today-2`
- **Status**: ✅ **Data is now being fetched successfully**
